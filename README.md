# Advent of Code Solutions

All solutions are written in **Zig**.

## Building and Running

To build and run a solution, use the following commands:

```bash
zig build-exe day01.zig -O ReleaseFast -fstrip
./day01.exe
```

Replace `day01` with the appropriate day number (e.g., `day02`, `day03`, etc.).
